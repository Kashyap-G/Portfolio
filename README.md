# Portfolio
# This repository is for me to collate the many different implementations, that I have worked on over the course of the last few years, as part of my computational physics course, PhD and Postdoctoral research.
# This should ideally include multiple xcode projects, that implement some of the following concepts:
# Partial Differential Equations -- Elliptic, Parabolic, Hyperbolic
# Graph Algorithms
# Data Structures
# Some neuronal models -- Single neuron models, Point neuron models, Brain Network Models, Neural Fields
# Demonstrate, maybe even graphically, key concepts that I have worked on during the course of my PhD and Postdoc.
